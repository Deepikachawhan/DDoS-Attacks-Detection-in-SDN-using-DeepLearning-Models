## 📄 Project Overview  
This project aims to detect Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) technologies. DDoS attacks pose a significant threat to network security, and traditional detection methods often fall short in dynamic SDN environments. This project explores the potential of advanced ML/DL models for accurate and timely DDoS detection.

## ⚙️ Methodology  
I. CLASSIFICATION
1. **🔧 Data Preprocessing:**  
   The dataset is cleaned, normalized, and prepared for model training.  

2. **🎯 Feature Engineering:**  
   Relevant features are selected or engineered to improve model performance.  

3. **🧠 Model Development:**  
   Several ML/DL models are implemented and trained, including:  
   - **📈 LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**  
   - **🔄 Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional LSTM)**  
   - **🌐 CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**  
   - **🤖 RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)**  
   - **⚖️ MLP (Multi-Layer Peceptron)**  
   - **🔁 TabNet**  


4. **📊 Model Evaluation:**  
   Models are evaluated using metrics such as:  
   - Accuracy ✅  
   - Precision 🎯  
   - Recall 🔁  
   - F1-Score 🏆  
   - AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) 📈  

5. **⚖️ Comparison:**  
   The performance of different models is compared to identify the most effective approach.  

II.
🔧Implement FEDERATED LEARNING for DDoS Detection (Workflow)
1. Prepare Data: Take each dataset as a client to simulate different network nodes.
2. Model Selection: Create an optimal custom deep learning model for attack detection.
3. FL Framework: Implement FL using Flower, FedAvg, or PySyft.
4. Local Training: Each client/node trains its model on local data (e.g., SDN controller logs).
5. Global Aggregation: The central server combines model updates for improved detection.
6. Evaluation: Assess the model’s performance on unseen attack patterns.
