Report on DDoS Attacks, Software-Defined Networks (SDN), and How DDoS Attacks Occur in SDN

OVERVIEW
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are a significant cybersecurity threat that disrupts network services by overwhelming them with traffic from multiple sources. Software-Defined Networks (SDN) offer a dynamic and programmable approach to networking but also introduce new vulnerabilities to DDoS attacks. This report explores deep-learning based classification of DDoS attacks on three datasets: LR-HR DDoS Attack, SNT-DDoS Attack, and DDoS-SDN-Tree.

DDoS ATTACKS
A DDoS attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic. These attacks often involve multiple compromised devices forming a botnet.

Types of DDoS Attacks
	Volumetric Attacks: Floods the target with excessive data (e.g., UDP Flood, ICMP Flood, DNS Amplification).
	Protocol Attacks: Exploits weaknesses in network protocols (e.g., SYN Flood, Ping of Death, Smurf Attack).
	Application-Layer Attacks: Targets specific applications (e.g., HTTP Flood, Slowloris attack).

Impact of DDoS Attacks
	Service downtime and financial losses
	Data corruption or loss
	Reputation damage
	Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, and bandwidth)

SOFTWARE-DEFINED NETWORKS (SDN)
SDN is an innovative network architecture that decouples the control plane from the data plane, allowing centralized network control and dynamic configuration through software applications.

Components of SDN
	Application Layer: Contains applications that define network behavior.
	Control Layer: The SDN controller acts as the brain, managing network traffic.
	Infrastructure Layer: Comprises physical or virtual network devices (switches, routers, etc.).

Benefits of SDN
	Improved network flexibility and scalability
	Centralized network management
	Enhanced security and monitoring
	Reduced operational costs




How DDoS Attacks Occur in SDN?

Vulnerabilities in SDN
	Centralized Control Plane: A single SDN controller is a prime target for attackers.
	Flow Table Overload: Attackers flood SDN switches with excessive flow requests, exhausting resources.
	Northbound API Exploits: Unauthorized access to the SDN controller through application-layer vulnerabilities.
	Southbound Protocol Attacks: Manipulation of OpenFlow or other communication protocols between the controller and devices.

Attack Methods in SDN
	Controller Targeting: Overwhelming the controller with requests, causing it to crash or become unresponsive.
	Data Plane Saturation: Flooding SDN switches with illegitimate traffic, leading to performance degradation.
	Resource Exhaustion: Manipulating network rules and policies to deplete memory and CPU resources.

Mitigation Strategies
	Anomaly Detection: Implementing Machine Learning (ML) models to detect and mitigate suspicious traffic patterns.
	Rate Limiting: Restricting the number of flow entries per second to prevent table exhaustion.
	Redundant Controllers: Deploying multiple SDN controllers to eliminate single points of failure.
	Security Policies: Enforcing strict authentication and encryption for northbound and southbound communications.

Deep Learning-Based Classification of DDoS Attacks

WHY?
Deep learning models can analyze traffic patterns and classify DDoS attacks based on learned representations. Different models are used based on dataset characteristics.
